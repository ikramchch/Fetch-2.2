- Added new method enableFileExistChecks(enabled: Boolean) on FetchConfiguration class
- Small fixes to ParallelDownloader

Version 2.2.0-RC11
- Fixed issue where downloads would get stuck in the queue and fetch would mark all downloads as failed.
- Behavior change: Fetch no longer mark downloads with a Failed status if the file on the disk storage system is not found.
                   If the file is not found and the download status is Queued or Paused, Fetch will simply start the download from the beginning.

Version 2.2.0-RC10
- Added new Fetch field named hasActiveDownloads. This field indicates if the fetch namespace has
active(downloading or queued) downloads. Use this field to keep background services using fetch
alive. This field is thread safe.

Version 2.2.0-RC9
- Fixed issue where different namespace Fetch instances shared the same logger object
- Breaking Change. Added new boolean param for add completed downloads method. Now:
fun addCompletedDownload(completedDownload, boolean, func, func2): Fetch
and
fun addCompletedDownloads(completedDownloadsList, boolean, func, func2): Fetch
 - Added documentation for Extras and MutableExtras classes.

Version 2.2.0-RC8

- Fixed issue where the callbacks returned wrong download object.
- Fixed issue where the download callbacks where not called.

Version 2.2.0-RC7
- Many fixes and performance improvements to the Parallel ParallelDownloader.
  Breaking changes Parallel Downloader: For a much needed performance and memory improvement changes has to be made
  to the way the Parallel downloader stores download information. Partially
  downloaded request from old versions of Fetch when moved to the new Parallel downloader will have to download from the start
  using the new format but will continue to work as expected after the first run.
- The created field for the Download and CompletedDownload objects are now in milliseconds.
  Breaking changes Created Field. Previously those field stored the created time in a mix of nanoseconds and milliseconds.
  You may need to do the conventions as necessary on downloads created with previous versions of Fetch.
- Files deleted outside of Fetch for a completed download no longer caused the download status to change to failed.
- Enqueuing downloads improvements
- Download Progress reporting fixes.
- Enqueue list method now ensures that each request in the list is distinct by file. If not, an error is thrown
  with the appropriate reason when the requests are being enqueued.
- RxFetch improvements and bug fixes
- Added new Fetch and RxFetch method fun addListener(listener: FetchListener, notify: Boolean, autoStart)
  You can now autoStart download processing after attaching a fetchListener.
- Added new Fetch method fun getFetchConfiguration(). This method returns the configuration object that created the Fetch instance.
- Added new object Extras and MutableExtras that makes to easy to store and get custom key/value pairs with type support for a request/download.
  Breaking Changes. The extras field on Request, CompletedDownload, FileResource has all been updated to use Extras object. Existing extras maps (Map<String, String) are migrated to
  the new extras object automatically.
- Added new Fetch and RxFetch method fun replaceExtras(id: Int, extras: Extras, func, func2) to replace the extras
  on an existing request/download stored in the Fetch database.
- Threads created by Fetch are now named. Improves debugging.
- FetchFileServer Delegate.Listener method names have been updated to better reflect their use.

- Allow downloadConcurrentLimit to be set to 0. Effectively that instance of Fetch can perform all normal actions except downloading requests.
- Can now set download concurrent limit on Fetch instance at runtime using method fun setDownloadConcurrentLimit(downloadConcurrentLimit: Int): Fetch
- Errors Fetch throws now have an attached throwable: eg `error.getThrowable()` that you can retrieve the exception that caused the Error. Note throwable may be null.
- Added new Parameters to FetchListener onStart method now: fun onStarted(download: Download, downloadBlocks: List<DownloadBlock>, totalBlocks: Int)
- Added new Parameters to FetchListener onError method now: fun onError(download: Download, error: Error, throwable: Throwable?)

Version 2.1.0-RC1
This version of Fetch contains many fixes and breaking changes.
Note: Uses will not lose downloads migrating to this version once the same namespace is set.
There are no behavioral changes in the way requests are downloaded.
Changes include method renaming and moving classes into a different packages. New in this
version of Fetch is the release of the FetchFileServer. See demo in sample app. The wiki for this repo will be updated
over the coming days.

Changes:
- Logger, Downloader, Func, Func2 and FetchLogger classes moved to com.tonyodev.fetch2core
- OkHttpDownloader class moved to com.tonyodev.fetch2okhttp. Add this dependency implementation "com.tonyodev.fetch2okhttp:fetch2okhttp:2.1.0-RC1" to your build.gradle file. 
- Fetch.Builder and RxFetch.Builder classes has been removed and is replaced with FetchConfiguration.Builder.
- To get an instance of Fetch call Fetch.Impl.getInstance(fetchConfiguration)
  or RxFetch.Impl.getInstance(fetchConfiguration) to get a new instance.
- You can now get a default instance of Fetch by calling Fetch.Impl.getDefaultInstance(). Be sure to set
  the default FetchConfiguration at least once before calling the getDefaultInstance() method. To set the default configuration
  call Fetch.Impl.setDefaultInstanceConfiguration(fetchConfiguration)
- To set a custom Http Downloader for Fetch, call setHttpDownloader(downloader) on the FetchConfiguration.Builder.
- To set the namespace of a Fetch instance, call setNamespace(namespace) on the FetchConfiguration.Builder.
- New method enableMd5Check(enabled) on the FetchConfiguration.Builder. If supported by the server, Fetch will check
  the md5 checksum after a download completes and will report errors if the md5 checksum does not match.
- You can now have multiple instance with the same namespace. All Fetch instances with the same namespace will
  be updated automatically.
- Closing an instance of Fetch no longer causes crashes and releases all resources when appropriate.
- Fetch Listeners are now held as weak references to reduce memory leaks.
- Fetch Listener onQueued method has been updated to onQueued(Download download, boolean waitingOnNetwork)
- New Kotlin friendly methods added to Fetch for enqueuing requests and querying download information.
- Request class now has an enqueueAction field which replaces RequestOptions.
- RequestOptions enum was removed and replaced with EnqueueAction enum. There are two EnqueueAction types available.
  REPLACE_EXISTING and INCREMENT_FILE_NAME. Each new Request has a default enqueue action of REPLACE_EXISTING
  which will replace any existing request that Fetch is managing with the same File. If INCREMENT_FILE_NAME
  is set on the request, Fetch will auto increment the file name for the request and return the updated
  request in the first callback of the enqueue method. Be sure to update your external request references
  with the updated request.
- Request class no longer allows you to set the id field of a request. Request class has new field called identifier.
  Use the identifier(Long) field to set your own unique id to identify a request or download.
- New enqueueAction and identifier  fields added on Download and Request class.
- Logging is now enabled by default in Fetch
- Fetch Error 12 and 14 removed. No longer needed because of EnqueueAction simplicity.

FetchFileServer
- Introducing the FetchFileServer. The FetchFileServer is a lightweight TCP File Server that acts like
  an HTTP file server designed specifically to share files between Android devices. You can host file resources
  with the FetchFileServer on one device and have Fetch download Files from the server
  on another device. See sample app for more information. Wiki on Fetch File Server will be
  added in the coming days.
- To download files from a FetchFileServer using Fetch, set a custom file server downloader on the
  FetchConfiguration.Builder class by calling the setFileServerDownloader(fileServerDownloader) method.
  The com.tonyodev.fetch2downloads package already contains a custom downloader called
  FetchFileServerDownloader that you can use and extend.
- You can also use the FetchFileServer without having to use Fetch to download files hosted by the
  file server. See the FetchFileResourceDownloadTask class inside the com.tonyodev.fetch2downloads
  package for more details.

Version 2.0.0-RC22
- Bug fix for progress reporting on Parallel downloads

Version 2.0.0-RC21
- Bug fix for status reporting on Parallel downloads

Version 2.0.0-RC20
- Added New FileDownloader types. Parallel and Sequential Downloaders.
  a)Parallel downloader slices a download in multiple parts allowing for faster download.
    This downloader processes the download over several background threads. Use the parallel downloader when system resources are not constrained.
  b)Sequential downloader is the default downloader, and processes a download request Sequentially.
    The download is processed on a single background thread. The Downloader is Generally Fast.
